# Climate Change Tweet Classifier 🌍

This project applies machine learning to classify climate change stance from Twitter data using structured metadata and text processing.  
The model predicts whether a tweet reflects a **pro-climate stance, denial, neutral, or factual reporting**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of Twitter text (stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Feature importance visualization for insights.
